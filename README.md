# OpenCamoCap

OpenSource camera face capture/tracking software.


## Why C++ and not XYZ?

While I would have liked doing it in another language, many frameworks don't support other languages or miss some features in other languages.

MediaPipe for example does allow facetracking in Python but it won't allow iris tracking.
